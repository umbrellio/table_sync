# CASES FOR DEBOUNCE

# Cached Sync Time -> CST - time last sync has occured or next sync will occur
# Next Sync Time   -> NST - time next sync will occur

# 0
# Condition: debounce_time is zero.
# No debounce, sync right now.
# Result: NST -> Time.current

# 1
# Condition: CST is empty.
# There was no sync before. Can be synced right now.
# Result: NST -> Time.current

# 2
# Condition: CST =< Time.current.
# There was a sync before.

# 2.1
# Subcondition: CST + debounce_time <= Time.current
# Enough time passed for debounce condition to be satisfied.
# No need to wait. Can by synced right now.
# Result: NST -> Time.current

# 2.2
# Subcondition: CST + debounce_time > Time.current
# Debounce condition is not satisfied. Must wait till debounce period has passed.
# Will be synced after debounce period has passed.
# Result: NST -> CST + debounce_time

# 3
# Condition: CST > Time.current
# Sync job has already been enqueued in the future.

# 3.1
# Subcondition: event -> update | create
# No need to sync upsert event, since it has already enqueued sync in the future.
# It will sync fresh version anyway.
# NST -> Skip, no sync.

# 3.2
# Subcondition: event -> destroy
# In this case the already enqueued job must be upsert.
# Thus destructive sync has to send message after upsert sync.
# NST -> CST + debounce_time
