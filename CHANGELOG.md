# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [6.0.0] - 2021-10-15
### Added

- A lot of specs for all the refactoring.
- Docs
- 100% coverage

### Changed
- Heavy refactoring of Publisher and BatchPublisher.
All code is separated in different modules and classes.

1. Job callables are now called:
- single_publishing_job_class_callable
- batch_publishing_job_class_callable

2. Now there are three main classes for messaging:
- TableSync::Publishing::Single - sends one row with initialization
- TableSync::Publishing::Batch  - sends batch of rows with initialization
- TableSync::Publishing::Raw    - sends raw data without checks

Separate classes for publishing, object data, Rabbit params, debounce, serialization.

3. Jobs are not constrained by being ActiveJob anymore. Just need to have #perform_at method

4. Changed some method names towards consistency:
- attrs_for_routing_key -> attributes_for_routing_key
- attrs_for_metadata    -> attributes_for_headers

5. Moved TableSync setup into separate classes.

6. Changed ORMAdapters.

7. Destroyed objects are initialized. 
Now custom attributes for destruction will be called on instances.
- Obj.table_sync_destroy_attributes() -> Obj#attributes_for_destroy

8. Event constants are now kept in one place.

### Removed

- Plugin Errors

## [5.1.0] - 2021-09-09

### Fixed
- Fix `delete` events being broken when either `#attrs_for_routing_key` or `#attrs_for_metadata` was defined on a model.

### Changed
- Instead of original attributes (default raw model attributes), use published attributes (as defined by `#attributes_for_sync` or `.table_sync_destroy_attributes`) for `TableSync.routing_key_callable` and `TableSync.routing_metadata_callable`.
- Send all original attributes for `delete` events instead of just PK.
